# DOCUMENTATION SOURCE: Create an effect template for use in Final Cut Pro | Apple Developer Documentation.pdf

Final Cut Pro ships with numerous effects, titles, transitions, and generators that were created in Motion. In Motion,
effects, titles, transitions, and generators, are collectively referred to as templates. You can modify these default Final
Cut Pro templates or create your own templates from scratch. If youʼre a content creator, you can use these templates
to build and distribute custom Final Cut Pro effects to other artists, to editors, or to clients.
See the Final Cut Pro templates overview in the Motion documentation for details on how to create your own custom
templates.
