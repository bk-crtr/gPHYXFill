# DOCUMENTATION SOURCE: Setting up for FxPlug development | Apple Developer Documentation.pdf

Developing FxPlug plug-ins requires that you have certain developer software installed on your Mac along with host
applications.
Your system must have the following software installed:
Xcode 15 or newer
FxPlug 4 SDK (download from Appleʼs developer website)
Motion 5.6.4 or newer
Final Cut Pro 10.6.6 or newer
Plug-ins can be used in Final Cut Pro for Mac and Motion, referred to as the host applications. Use plug-ins directly in
Motion; in Final Cut Pro, however, you must wrap plug-ins in a template, as described in Preparing plug-ins for use in
Final Cut Pro. Once built, macOS automatically recognizes the plug-ins and vends them to the host applications on
request.
Using out-of-process FxPlug plug-ins
Register and render FxPlug plug-ins with Motion and Final Cut Pro.
