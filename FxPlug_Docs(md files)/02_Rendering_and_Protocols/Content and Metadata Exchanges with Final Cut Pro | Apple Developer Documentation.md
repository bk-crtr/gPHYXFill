# DOCUMENTATION SOURCE: Content and Metadata Exchanges with Final Cut Pro | Apple Developer Documentation.pdf

Help your users exchange data between Final Cut Pro and your app, and avoid unwieldy manual processes. With
FCPXML representing media, metadata, and Final Cut Pro items, your users can send data from your app to Final Cut
Pro for editing, or receive rendered media (movies) and editing decisions from Final Cut Pro projects in your app for
further processing.
FCPXML is a specialized format that uses XML elements to describe the data going between your app and Final Cut Pro.
With FCPXML simplifying the data exchange, app users can:
Send large quantities of media from an asset management tool to be edited in Final Cut Pro.
Send media clips—annotated with ratings, keywords, and metadata—and let Final Cut Pro organize the incoming
media.
Receive rendered media and editing decisions for a project—including lists of media used—from Final Cut Pro for
further processing, such as color grading and correction.
Receive rendered media (movies) in an app to finish and package for delivery, playout, or archiving.
Record an audio/video stream and start editing the media in Final Cut Pro while the file is still being recorded.
Sending Media and Metadata to Final Cut Pro
Send media assets, timeline sequences, and metadata from your app to Final Cut Pro.
Supporting Drag and Drop for Data Sent to Final Cut Pro
Add drag and drop support so your users can drag media assets and timeline sequences from your app directly
into Final Cut Pro.
Sending Data Programmatically to Final Cut Pro
Manage and streamline the sending of batches of media assets and timeline sequences from your app using Apple
events.
Sending media to Final Cut Pro as itʼs recorded
Designate media as a growing file to make it available to users while itʼs still being recorded.
Supporting Drag and Drop to Receive Final Cut Pro Data
Add drag and drop support in your app to give users an intuitive way to receive clips, projects, and other items from
Final Cut Pro.
Receiving Media and Data Through a Custom Share Destination
Receive rendered media (movies), editing descriptions for project timelines, library archives, and FCPXML for other
Final Cut Pro items in your app.
Workflow Extensions
Integrate your appʼs workflow within the Final Cut Pro interface to streamline data exchange.
FCPXML Reference
Create documents that describe the data your app or workflow extension exchanges with Final Cut Pro.
